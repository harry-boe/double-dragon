# Double Dragon - Single Y Alpha-1 Release 2022-02-06


This is a sigle Y version of the "Voron V0.1 Double Dragon IDEX" printer 

## Also called "Ant-Man and the Wasp" 

The goal of this version is to get away with a common Octopus or spider board that has only 7 steppers.
Second goal is to save costs and proviede an upgrade path from a standard V0 kit.

Ther is no BOM yet but to get an idea.

* The prototype is based o a standard kit. 
* I used an aditional frame set and boted the short extrusion to the loger extrusions unsing a 14mm set screw
(https://www.hpiracing.com/en/part/100554)
* This way I can keep the color scema.
* The gantry and Bed mount (i.e. mooving parts=) are than built with the regular extrusions from the kit.

Abvuoisly you need one more toolhead an the Y-stepper (same as A/B)
